          <p>Welcome to my basic portfolio page. I started this site to showcase some of my interests, hobbies,
            past-times or whatever else you may call them. In recent years I have been called a renaissance man. That
            is, a person with many talents. I love to learn and I also love to teach others what I have learned.
          </p>
          <p>As I have already mentioned, I love to learn. All of my interests/talents started as a basic curiosity that
            I needed to learn more about.

            My most recent interest that is worth talking about is cooking. It wasn't until only a year and a half ago
            that I started becoming very interested in cooking. I was never the cook in the house. Actually, I was the
            person who told everyone I can't cook. The dish that made me really start cooking a lot was yellow thai
            curry soup. I started ordering yellow curry at every restaurant that served it. I liked the stuff so much I
            just had to make it at home. I found all the ingredients and made everything from scratch. It was a long
            process but well worth it. Now, I enjoy cooking several dishes that I used to only order in restaurants and
            tinkering with the recipe.

            There are many things that I enjoy doing. Enjoy checking out my portfolio! Also, I look forward to hearing
            from you!
